# Dictionary-web-app
The challenge was to build a dictionary web app using the [Dictionary API](https://dictionaryapi.dev/) and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

Users can:
- Search for words using the input field
- See the free Dictionary API's response for the searched word
- Play the audio file for the word when it is available
- Switch between light and dark themes
- Switch between serif, sans serif, and monospace fonts
- See a form validation message when trying to submit a blank form
- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size

# Quick Start
1. Clone this repository
2. Run `npm install`
3. Run `npm run dev` to start client
